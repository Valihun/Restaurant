Step 1:
	Define WHO the website is for?
		For a client


	Define WHAT the website is for?
		Business goal is to sell monthly food subscription
		User goal is to eat well effortlessly, without spending a lot of time and money

	Define target audience
		Busy people who like technology, are interested in a healthy diet, and have a well-paid job


Step 2:
	Plan and gather the website content

	Plan out the sitemap
		For this project I'll build the one-page marketing website (oftentimes called a landing page), so no sitemap

	Define website personality
		Based on a tech-centered target audience, as well as the actual product being sold, we will use the STARTUP/UPBEAT
		personality. We might add some elements of the CALM/PEACE personality, since the product is all about consumer
		well-being as well.

	Plan page sections
		- Logo + Navigation
		- Hero
		- Featured In
		- How it works
		- Meals (and list of diets)
		- Testimonials + Gallery
		- Pricing + Features
		- CTA (Call To Action)
		- Footer
